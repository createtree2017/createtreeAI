Please continue enhancing the Maternity AI utility platform with the following prioritized improvements:

---

🌟 1. Show Available Styles Before Image Upload

📌 Problem:
Currently, the user can’t see the available image transformation styles until they upload a photo. This reduces user engagement and hides a key selling point of the service.

📌 Required Changes:
- Move the “Choose Your Magical Style” section above the image upload box.
- Always display style options (e.g., Ghibli, Watercolor, Korean Webtoon), even before a photo is uploaded.
- Include visual thumbnails or mini previews for each style.
- Add a carousel with sample transformed images to help inspire users.
- Keep the “Transform My Photo” button disabled until a file is uploaded, with a tooltip like: “Please upload an image to continue.”

🌐 2. Add Korean Translation Support (ko.json)

- Generate and upload a `ko.json` file with Korean translations for all UI labels, tooltips, and messages.
- When the user’s browser language is set to Korean (`ko`), default to using `ko.json` as the interface language.
- This completes the internationalization functionality for bilingual support.

🧪 3. Complete A/B Testing Functionality

- The A/B testing UI tab exists, but the functionality is not yet active.
- Add the ability to:
  - Store and manage two prompt variations per concept (Prompt A and Prompt B).
  - Record user selection or preference between the two.
  - Display side-by-side previews with voting buttons or toggle UI.
- This helps evaluate which prompt version produces better visual results.

🧼 4. Validate i18n Translation Key Coverage

- Check all UI elements across the platform and make sure they use proper translation keys.
- Remove any hardcoded English strings.
- This ensures full scalability for future languages and localization efforts.

These upgrades improve user experience before upload, increase international accessibility, and enable data-driven improvement of visual content generation.

Please confirm when each step is complete so I can review the results and guide the next iteration.
