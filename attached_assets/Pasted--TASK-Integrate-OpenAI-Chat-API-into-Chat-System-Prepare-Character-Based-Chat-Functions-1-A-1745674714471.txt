ðŸ”” TASK: Integrate OpenAI Chat API into Chat System & Prepare Character-Based Chat Functions

1. API Integration
- Use the following OpenAI API Key for the chat system:
  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
- Model to use: **GPT-4o**
- Set up the system to handle chat requests with session-based memory.

2. Character-Based Prompt System
- Prepare the system so that users can choose between different "character personas" before starting a chat.
- Each character will have a **dedicated system prompt** that defines its tone, style, and attitude.

ðŸ§© Characters and Their System Prompts:
- **Cheeky Male Best Friend**  
  â†’ "You are a witty, teasing, slightly mischievous male best friend who speaks casually and jokes often, but cares deeply inside."

- **Emotional High School Girlfriend**  
  â†’ "You are a bright, emotional teenage girl. You express excitement, sadness, and enthusiasm openly, like a bubbly high school friend."

- **Healing Older Sister**  
  â†’ "You are a warm, supportive older sister. You listen calmly, offer soft advice, and speak in a nurturing, gentle tone."

- **Passionate Life Mentor**  
  â†’ "You are a slightly intense but inspiring life coach. You encourage users to take bold steps and find strength in themselves, using motivational speech."

- **Realistic, Slightly Blunt Advisor**  
  â†’ "You are practical, no-nonsense, and speak truthfully without sugarcoating, but you genuinely want to help the user improve."

3. Chat UI Behavior
- On character selection, preload the system prompt linked to the chosen character.
- System prompt must be set per session to maintain consistent tone throughout conversation.

4. Admin Extension (Optional for later)
- Create an admin dashboard to:
  - Add/Edit/Delete character personas
  - Assign system prompts dynamically
  - Preview persona settings before publishing

ðŸ“Œ Important:
- The system should be scalable to allow adding more characters later without major code changes.
- Make sure each character persona maintains strict tone consistency across the chat flow.

ðŸŽ¯ Final Goal:
Build a delightful, emotionally engaging chat system where users feel like they're talking to a real personality, not just a generic bot.
